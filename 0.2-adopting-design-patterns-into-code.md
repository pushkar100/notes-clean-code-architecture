## Creational Design Patterns

**Definition**: Creational design patterns provide mechanisms to create objects.

There are **8 creational design patterns**:

1. **Constructor**
2. **Module**
3. **Revealing Module**
4. **Singleton**
5. **Prototype**
6. **Factory**
7. **Abstract Factory**
8. **Builder**

### Constructor 

A special method used to initialize a newly created object once the memory has been allocated. Object constructors are used to prepare the object for accepting arguments to set the values of (1) member properties and (2) methods when the object is first created.

```js
// 3 ways: Prior to ES2015
// (1) Object literal:
const newObject = {};

// (2) Creating from the Object prototype:
const newObject = Object.create(Object.prototype);

// (3) Instantiating from the main Object using "new":
const newObject = new Object();

// Bonus: Inheritance
const newObject = Object.create(person); // Creates an object that inherits from "person" object
```

**Classes in ES2015+** 

```js
class Car {
  constructor(model, year) {
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
  toString() {
    return `${this.model} was released in the year ${this.year}`
  }
}
const civic = new Car('Honda Civic', 2009);
civic.toString(); // 'Honda Civic was released in the year 2009'
```

Drawbacks of the above simple class:

1. Makes inheritance difficult 
2. `toString()` method is created for each object created using the `Car` constructor i.e the method is not shared

**Constructors with prototypes**

```js
class Car {
  constructor(model, year) {
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
  
}
Car.prototype.toString = function() {
    return `${this.model} was released in the year ${this.year}`
}
const civic = new Car('Honda Civic', 2009);
const kiaSonet = new Car('Kia Sonet', 2017);
// Both civic and kiaSonet share the same memory for the toString() method (which is on the prototype)
```

The above type of class is better for both inheritance and sharing common methods.

### Module

A module is a piece of architecture that helps keep a unit of code for a project *cleanly separated* and *organized*.

The Module pattern provides *private* and *public encapsulation of units of code* (generally, classes in conventional software engineering).

**Prior to ES2015**: Usage of *IIFEs* that return objects. Private properties would be what is in the closure of the IIFE and public would be what is returned as part of the object

**ES2015+**: Use the module (a file) that provides the `export` and `import` keywords

```js
// counter.js
let counter = 0; // Private variable

const testModule = {
  incrementCounter() { // Public method
    counter++
  }
  readCounter() { // Public method
    return counter;
  }
};

export default testModule;
```

```js
// test.js
import testModule from './counter';

testModule.incrementCounter(); // Namespaced method i.e It is never global!
testModule.incrementCounter();
testModule.readCounter(); // '2'
```

**Advantages**:

1. Private variables (No global state)
2. Only expose necessary properties and variables (Public interface)
3. Namespaced properties and methods when used externally (No global scope pollution)

**Disadvantages: Mostly minor since this is a well-accepted and widely-used pattern**

1. We access public and private member differently
2. Methods added later to the namespaced object  cannot access private values
3. Inability to create automated unit tests for private members and additional complexity when bugs require hot fixes

*Alternate way of using a module pattern*: Using *WeakMaps* for maintaining private properties for a class that are tied to the object instance and are easily garbage collected (since it is a weak map) once the reference to the object is gone! (***Advanced!*** mostly academic and not required - read from the book if necessary). With TypeScript, this might not even be needed (?).

*Example*: Using the module pattern in React; Each component is placed inside its own file, a module, and then exported for use by other components i.e other modules.

### Revealing Module

A variation of the Module pattern where *accessing public methods or variables* becomes *easier* since you do not need to use the main object namespace within the module. This basically removes the frustration of using the dot(.) notation everytime you wish to use a public method inside another (within the module).

Also, it allows us to "*reveal*" the public name with a different name than the function or variable within the module

```js
// Basic: Just the Module pattern:
let counter = 0; // Private variable

const testModule = {
  incrementCounter() { // Public method
    counter++
  },
  incrementCounterAndRead() { // Public method
    // The point of frustration! Why use object dot(.) to access a method internally:
    this.incrementCounter(); 
    return counter;
  }
};

export default testModule;
```

```js
// Revealing Module pattern:
let counter = 0; // Private variable

const incrementCounter = () => { // Public method
  counter++
};

const incrementCounterAndRead = () => { // Public method
  // Frustration solved! We do not need to use the object dot(.) notation everytime
  // we refer to a public method or variable from another public method:
  incrementCounter(); 
  return counter;
}

const counterModule = {
  increment: incrementCounter, // "Revealing" the public method with an optionally different name
  incrementAndRead: incrementCounterAndRead
};

export default testModule;
```

### Singleton

A pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to *coordinate actions* across the system.

**Static classes versus Singletons**: Singletons can delay their initialization *(lazy instantiation)* because they require certain information that may not be available during initialization time. Static classes cannot wait on initialization. Singleton is important for *resource-intensive objects*.

>The instance is created on demand: The instance is not created the moment it's declared. Instead, it is created lazily, in a First In First Out (FIFO) fashion. This has the benefit of avoiding expensive initializations when starting applications.

> Static classes or a regular object that is a global variable might be created when your application begins. Right? What if this object is resource intensive and your application never ends up using it? As you will see, with the Singleton Pattern, we can create our objects only when they are needed.

**ES2015+** allows you to create a global instance of a JavaScript class that is instantiated once and this instance can be exposed via a module export

***JavaScript approach:***

```js
// MySingleton.js
let instance;

const publicProperty = "Example public property";

class MySingleton {
  constructor() {
    // Pattern is a bit like a cache aside policy where if it is a cache miss,
    // you update the cache with the new value and return the cache value itself.
    if (!instance) {
      // ...Define public properties here...
      this.publicProperty = publicProperty;
      instance = this;
    }
    return instance;
  }
  
  // Public methods:
  publicMethod() {
    console.log('Public property');
  }
}

export default MySingleton;
```

```js
// test.js
import MySingleton from './MySingleton';

const aSingleton = new MySingleton();
const bSingleton = new MySingleton();
aSingleton === bSingleton; // true
aSingleton.publicMethod === bSingleton.publicMethod; // true
```

**Benefits of Singleton:**

* Useful for maintaining system wide data such as *configs* or *controllers*: **Exactly one object is needed to coordinate others across a system**
  * Other examples: The Singleton is used to control access to external resources such as *database connections*, *API endpoints*, or *filesystems*, *registry settings*. Also, it is used for *objects that act as device drivers to devices like printers and graphics cards*, or to *manage pools of resources, like connection or thread pools*.

**Drawbacks:**

* *Do not overuse* Singletons (or static classes)
  * Challenging to test and identifying a Singleton can be difficult: Difficult to mock and manage side-effects
    * Need to unit test: *Behaviour of the class* plus *the fact that only one instance gets created*
  * Hard to implement: Needs careful orchestration since it is usually used to store data across the global scope
  * Global instance pollution: Since it is usually used as a global variable

**Note:** 

* Singleton in JavaScript ***might be a code smell*** since unlike other languages such as C++ or Java where we need a class to instantiate an object, JavaScript provides us with **object literals** that can be our singleton (i.e we do not need a class). An object, in combination with an immutable library, can coordinate across the system without needing a singleton "class".
* **State management in React:** *Why did we not use a Singleton to manage state in React over Redux?* This is because even though a Singleton is across the system, it does not guarantee *immutability*. Libraries such as Redux provide an entire architecture (`flux`) to maintain uni-directional data flow and immutability on state change.

***TypeScript approach:***

![Singleton UML](https://i.imgur.com/1EOvDzl.png)

1. **Classic approach**: To get a hold of a Singleton object, you don’t instantiate one, you just ask for an instance. 
   1. Create a base class
   2. Create a *private constructor* (so that it is not instantiated multiple times by mistake)
      1. *Why?* It is because then the code inside the class is the only code that could call it
   3. Hold the instance as a *static property* (so that it is cached)
   4. *Expose a static method* to provide single access (i.e only one object ever created)

```ts
// singleton.ts
export default class Singleton {
  private static instance: Singleton;
	// ...Other useful instance variables here...
  
  private constructor(/* ...args... */) {
    // Declare and assign properties i.e fields
  }

  static getInstance(/* ...args... */) {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton(/* ...args... */);
      // If we never need the instance, it never gets created; this is lazy instantiation.
    }

    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  // ...Other methods can follow...
}
```

```ts
// test.ts
import Singleton from './singleton';

const aSingleton = Singleton.getInstance();
const bSingleton = Singleton.getInstance();
aSingleton === bSingleton; // true
```

2. **Modern implementations**: Literally use the module concept to create a class and export an object instantiated from it i.e delegate the control of the Singleton to the module system
   1. ***Drawback***: Instantiation is done at the *module import time*. The caller *cannot instantiate it lazily.*
   2. ***Drawback (NodeJs)***: As long as we import this file and it resolves to the same absolute path, then the module system will use the same cached instance. It might not be the case if your code resides in `node_modules` as a dependency with a conflicting version. An example of absolute paths being different:
      1. `/users/theo/projects/typescript-4-design-patterns/node_modules/MyLibrary/node_modules/singleton/ModuleSingleton.ts`
      2. `/users/theo/projects/typescript-4-design-patterns/node_modules/OtherLibrary/node_modules/singleton/ModuleSingleton.ts`

```ts
class Singleton {
  // A regular class
};

export default new Singleton(); // Export an instance
```

3. **Variations**

*Limitation of Singleton*: You cannot pass on initialization parameters when you first instantiate the object.

Ex: `UsersAPISingleton.getInstance('/v1/users').getUsers()` and `UsersAPISingleton.getInstance('/v2/users').getUsers()` will both return the same object even though the initial parameters passed were different.

*Solution*: Use the **Parametric Singleton pattern**, where instead of keeping a sole instance for the Singleton, you keep multiple ones cached by a key. **Why**? You want to generate a unique key based on the parameters supplied in the getInstance method. Therefore, when passing two different parameters it should return a different object, and passing the same one will return the same object.

```ts
class ParametricSingleton {
  private static instances: Map<string, ParametricSingleton>;
  private param: string;

  constructor(param: string) {
    this.param = param;
    // ...Other fields can follow...
  }

  static getInstance(param: string) {
    if (!ParametricSingleton.instances.has(param)) {
      ParametricSingleton.instances.set(param, new ParametricSingleton(param));
    }

    return ParametricSingleton.instances.get(param);
  }

  // ...Other methods can follow...
}
```

**Note: Multithreading can cause Singletons to be instantiated more than once**

* *Failure*: Multiple instances of a Singleton can be instantiated by different threads that have got access to the "if-clause" of the `getInstance` method at the same time i.e before one thread successfully instantiates an object completely before another thread can execute this `getInstance` method
* *Solution*: In some languages (like Java), we can make method execution *synchronous* (Ex: have `getInstance` be defined synchronous). This provides a lock on that method during multi-threaded access. This solves the problem but the drawback is that the wait might be expensive if it is synchronous. Also, we only need the `getInstance` to be synchronous initially, until the first instance is created; multi-threading works fine after this.
  * *Performant solutions*: Moving to an eagerly created instance, "double-checked locking", using Java enums to create singletons, etc to reduce the use of synchronization in `getInstance()` ) (Read more about these in "Head First Design Patterns, 2nd Ed")

**Note: Singleton pattern violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

* True! A singleton class manages both its (1) main role (biz logic) as well as (2) instance access logic i.e *two responsibilities*
* However, this can be treated as an *exception* to SRP since *there is utility in a class managing its own instance; it makes the overall design simpler*
* Still, purist clean code developers would like to abstract out the Singleton functionality away from the class

### Prototype

Prototype pattern is one that creates objects based on a template of an existing object.

It is based on the prototype inheritance mechanism in JavaScript.

***JavaScript approach:***

1. *Simple*: We can use `Object.create(prototype)` to clone an object. The object passed in as argument is used as the prototype for the newly created object. If we wish to optionally specify more properties i.e either modify or add, we can pass in a second argument of property descriptors for it.
   * It can be used for *inheriting directly* from an object i.e new object's `__proto__` points to the current object

```js
const myObject = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  foo() {
    console.log('foo')
  }
};

// Inheriting directly:
const clonedObject = Object.create(myObject);
clonedObject.__proto__ === myObject; // true
```

2. *Modern*: Use a class and provide a `clone()` method
   1. Using a class' `prototype` property to clone those methods i.e by reference
   2. Use the `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` to:
      1. Add current object's own properties to the new object, and
      2. Modify or add new properties to the cloned object

```js
class Wizard {
  constructor(name, power) {
    this.name = name;
    this.power = power;
  }
  
  updateName(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  clone() {
    // Step 1: Create from the class prototype - cloned object gets pr
    const clonedObject = Object.create(Wizard.prototype || null);
    // Step 2 (optional): Modify or add keys to the cloned object
    Object.getOwnPropertyNames(this).map(key => {
      if (key === 'name') {
        clonedObject[key] = 'unknown';
      } else {
        clonedObject[key] = this[key];
      }
    });
    return clonedObject;
  }
}

const harryPotter = new Wizard('Harry', 'Dumb things');
const ronWeasley = harryPotter.clone();
ronWeasley; // Wizard { name: 'unknown', power: 'Dumb things', __proto__: 
// { constructor: ƒ Wizard(), updateName: ƒ updateName(), clone: ƒ clone() } }

ronWeasley.updateName('Ron');
ronWeasley.name; // 'Ron'
harryPotter.name; // 'Harry'
```

**Benefits**:

1. Since prototypal inheritance works on maintaining references to existing methods instead of copying them, it is a performance boost!
2. Directly copying objects instead of relying on classes is possible (Not possible in pure OOP languages like Java and C++)
   1. You can create objects based on different hierarchies at runtime without using the new operator every time

***TypeScript approach:***

Similar to the modern approach of plain JS:

1. Create an *interface* for a clonable object that the class implements
2. Create the class with the `clone` method
   1. Use a class' `prototype` property to clone those methods i.e by reference
   2. Use the `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` to:
      1. Add current object's own properties to the new object, and
      2. Modify or add new properties to the cloned object

![Prototype pattern UML](https://i.imgur.com/peYkSn4.png)

```ts
interface HeroPrototype {
  clone(): HeroPrototype
};

class Wizard implements HeroPrototype {
  name: string;
  private power: string;

  constructor(name: string, power: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.power = power;
  }
  
  updateName(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  clone() {
    // Step 1: Create from the class prototype - cloned object gets pr
    const clonedObject = Object.create(Wizard.prototype || null);
    // Step 2 (optional): Modify or add keys to the cloned object
    Object.getOwnPropertyNames(this).map((key: string) => {
      if (key === 'name') {
        clonedObject[key] = 'unknown';
      } else {
        clonedObject[key] = this[key];
      }
    });
    
    return clonedObject;
  }
}

const harryPotter = new Wizard('Harry', 'Dumb things');
const ronWeasley = harryPotter.clone();
ronWeasley; // Wizard { name: 'unknown', power: 'Dumb things', __proto__: 
// { constructor: ƒ Wizard(), updateName: ƒ updateName(), clone: ƒ clone() } }

ronWeasley.updateName('Ron');
ronWeasley.name; // 'Ron'
harryPotter.name; // 'Harry'
```

**Note**: For a *deep copy*, use `return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this)); //deep copy`

**Drawbacks:**

1. Creating your own `clone` method for every object that implements this interface is *cumbersome*. If you decide to provide a base clone method and then use inheritance for all the sub-classes, then you are basically contradicting yourself. You specifically tried avoiding using inheritance when creating new objects, but now you are using it for this method. Judging from the previous issues, you need to make sure you only evaluate this pattern for specific use cases and certain objects you want to construct from existing ones. This way, you minimize any coupling introduced by inheritance.
2. The Prototype pattern is used to create new objects from already created instances by calling their clone method. This suffers the disadvantage that when you rely only on the Prototype interface, you may have to cast the object again to the right instance type as you won't have any other field accessible.

### Factory

It is a creational design pattern that does not explicitly require us instantiating a constructor of a class. It provides a generic interface for creating objects where we can specify the type of factory object we want to create.

> When you see “new,” think “concrete.” Tying your code to a concrete class can make it more fragile and less flexible. So, in other words, your code will not be “closed for modification.”

Factory pattern keeps our design "open for extension" but closed for modification.

It is useful *if the object creation process is relatively complex*. That is, if it depends on *dynamic factors* or *application configuration*.

* The objects you want to create usually share a *common characteristic*; they are similar in nature or in type, or they are part of a hierarchy.
* This pattern deals with the creation of objects and particularly with *delegating the creation of objects using sub-classes*.

**Using the Factory method assumes you want to avoid the traditional way of creating objects and instead you describe what you want to create.**

***JavaScript approach***

```js
class Car {
  constructor({ model, year }) {
    this.type = "Car";
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

class Truck {
  constructor({ model, year }) {
    this.type = "Truck";
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

class VehicleFactory {
  constructor() {
    this.defaultVehicle = Car;
  }
  
  createVehicle(options) {
    const { model, ...rest } = options;
    switch(model) {
      case "car":
        return new Car({ model, ...rest });
      case "truck": {
        return new Truck({ model, ...rest });
      }
    }
    // Default can be car:
    return new (this.defaultVehicle)({ model, ...rest });
  }
}

const vehicleFactory = new VehicleFactory();
const myCar = vehicleFactory.createVehicle({ model: 'mycar', year: 2009 }); // Instance of Car
const myTruck = vehicleFactory.createVehicle({ model: 'mytruck', year: 2011 }); // Instance of Truck
vehicleFactory.createVehicle({ year: 2024 }); // Car { type: 'Car', model: undefined, year: 2024,.. }
```

**When to use factory patterns?**

1. Object or component set up involves a high level of complexity (i.e we need a convenient way to instantiate them than just building it via the constructor)
2. When we are work with *smaller objects or components* (that solve sub-problems for a high level problem (?)) that share the same properties
3. When composing objects with instances of other objects that need only satisfy an API contract (aka , duck typing to work). This is useful for *decoupling*. ***An example of clean coding is combining dependency injection with factory methods/classes.***

An example of point number 2 is: When you have a list of various objects with a parent-child relationship, such as `Element`, `HTMLElement`, `HTMLSpanElement`, and so on, it is not ideal to create them typically using the new operator. You want to have a description of the elements you want to create and the factory will create them for you.

***TypeScript approach***

1. You use an *interface* with a distinct `create` method
2. Provide concrete classes that implement this factory and construct objects of a particular sub-class

![Factory UML](https://i.imgur.com/NYr2G34.png)

> When you have multiple types of objects that either inherit from a similar class or have a similar role, then you may find that passing each type as a parameter is cumbersome. You will have to create all those different function versions or methods to deal with those diverse types.

> So instead of considering using the new operator to create those objects manually, we define a Factory method called create that accepts either an interface or a type variable that describes what you want to create. This Factory method will abstract all the inner details of creating the right object and return it for you.

```ts
interface Weapon {
  getName(): string;
  getDamage(): number;
  getRange(): number;
}

class LongSword implements Weapon {
  getName(): string {
    return "LongSword";
  }
  getDamage(): number {
    return 10;
  }
  getRange(): number {
    return 2;
  }
}

class LongBow implements Weapon {
  getName(): string {
    return "LongBow";
  }
  getDamage(): number {
    return 8;
  }
  getRange(): number {
    return 16;
  }
}
```

```ts
// Try to avoid creating the LongSword and LongBow using the `new` operator and 
// instead you define a factory for each one of the weapons
interface WeaponFactory {
  create(): Weapon;
}

class LongSwordFactory implements WeaponFactory {
  create(): Weapon {
    return new LongSword();
  }
}

class LongBowFactory implements WeaponFactory {
  create(): Weapon {
    return new LongBow();
  }
}

const lbf = new LongBowFactory();
const lsf = new LongSwordFactory();
const factories: WeaponFactory[] = [lbf, lsf, lbf];
factories.forEach((f: WeaponFactory) => {
  console.debug(f.create());
});
// Prints:
// LongBow { }
// LongSword { }
// LongBow { }
```

**Alternate implementation: Using a single factory function**

```ts
const enum WeaponType {
  LONGBOW,
  LONGSWORD,
}

class WeaponCreator {
  create(weaponType: WeaponType): Weapon {
    switch (weaponType) {
      case WeaponType.LONGBOW: {
        return new LongBow();
      }
      case WeaponType.LONGSWORD: {
        return new LongSword();
      }
      default: {
        throw new Error('Unidentified weapon type');
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*Drawback* with the alternate factory implementation that does not use an interface

* It can become a burden if you will have to constantly update the `WeaponType` enum and `switch` cases.

**Real-world examples of a Factory pattern:** 

DOM APIs:

```js
const divElement= document.createElement("div");
const content document.createTextNode("Hello");
const event = document.createEvent('Event');
```

Notice how simple and unified this API is. As a client of this API, you won't need to know all the details of how to create div elements or event types. Instead, you describe a type you want to have and the factory creates that for you.

### Abstract Factory

It is a factory pattern that aims to *encapsulate a group of individual factories* with a *common goal*.

When to use? You can use an Abstract Factory when a system must be *independent of how the objects it creates are generated*, or *it needs to work with multiple types of objects*.

* You can think of this pattern as a ***factory of factories***
  * Using this pattern, you retain the flexibility to define multiple concrete implementations for the factories without altering the process of using them
  * The client code is easier to change and manages a different factory at runtime

> The fundamental reason to use this pattern is if you absolutely want to have a runtime client that can interchange different factory objects at runtime, thus producing a different representation or hierarchies. If you want to include a new factory, you will need to implement the Abstract Factory interface and make the client aware of the new type. No other changes are required for the client side. (*Flexibility*)

**Example requirement**:  Instead of creating a factory of an object, you need to create a factory of related objects. 

***JavaScript approach***

Using the above listed classes, `Car` and `Truck` (in the factory patterns example), we can have an abstract factory that first registers a vehicle with itself and only on these registered, i.e allowed vehicles, do we allow instantiation.

```js
class Car {
  constructor({ model, year }) {
    this.type = "Car";
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

class Truck {
  constructor({ model, year }) {
    this.type = "Truck";
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

class AbstractVehicleFactory {
  constructor() {
    this.types = {};
  }
  
  registerVehicle(type, Vehicle) {
    // ... Can add conditions necessary to register a vehicle
    this.types[type] = Vehicle;
    return this;
  }
  
  createVehicle(type, customizations) {
    const Vehicle = this.types[type];
    return new Vehicle(customizations);
  }
}

const vehicleFactory = new AbstractVehicleFactory();
vehicleFactory
  .registerVehicle('car', Car)
  .registerVehicle('truck', Truck);

const myCar = vehicleFactory.createVehicle('car', { model: 'mycar', year: 2009 }); // Instance of Car
const myTruck = vehicleFactory.createVehicle('truck', { model: 'mytruck', year: 2011 }); // Instance of Truck
```

}
interface Footer {
  content: string;
}
```

```ts
// Abstract factory
class HTMLWebsitePageFactory implements WebsitePageFactory {
  createHeader(text: string): HTMLHeader {
    return new HTMLHeader(text);

```ts
// Concrete implementation

  content: string;
  constructor(text: string) {
    this.content = '<head>${text}</head>';
  }
}
class HTMLContent implements Content {
  content: string;
  constructor(text: string) {
    this.content = '<main>${text}</main>';

    this.content = '<footer>${text}</footer>';
  }
}

### Builder

Builder is a creational design pattern that you can use to deal with the step-by-step construction of objects that can have multiple future representations.

Quite often you create objects that take more than two or three parameters and many of those parameters are not known ahead of time. They are required, though, to initialize the object with the right state.

**Note**: For clean coding practices, it is better to have a class' props intialized only once! That is, only in the constructor. If we have setters (Ex: `setProp`) that can set properties at a later time, it makes the class mutable and that is not clean architecture in general. Therefore, we can make classes immutable by initializing props only inside the cosntructor, on initialization and also provide a Builder pattern that provides methods to the caller to gradually collect all the properties and another method to finally instantiate the object from the class. No further prop changes from callers are allowed.

**When do we use Builder?**

1. Need a common set of steps to create an object
2. You can have multiple representations of an object, maybe as variants or as a sub-class type. *If you do not anticipate or require to have more than one representation in the future, then this pattern would look over-engineered and unnecessary.*

> * Does it have more than three parameters? 
> * Many of those parameters are optional and if you don't provide them then will you get a default one? 
> * Are all of the steps to create one independent?
>
> If you answer **no** to any of those questions, then you likely do not need to use the Builderpattern just yet.

***JavaScript Approach***

```js
class TextOptions {
  private font: Font; 
  private fontSize: number;
  constructor(font: Font, fontSize: number) {
    this.font = font;
    this.fontSize = fontSize;
  }
  getFont(): Font {
    return font;
  }
  getFontSize(): number {
    return fontSize;
  }
}
class TextOptionsBuilder {
  private font: Font;
  private fontSize: number;
  constructor(font: Font) {
    this.font = font;
  }
  setFontSize(fontSize: number): TextOptionsBuilder {
    this.fontSize = fontSize;
    return this;
  }
  build(): TextOptions {
    return new TextOptions(font, fontSize);
  }
}

const myTextOptions = new TextOptionsBuilder(Font.ARIAL);

// Can set values later ...
myTextOptions
  .setFontSize(12.0)
  .build(); // ... but once you build, it cannot be mutated!
```

***TypeScript Approach***

![Builder 2](https://i.imgur.com/YPbtqVL.png)

![Builder UML 3](https://i.imgur.com/PcyucIm.png)

The key observation over here is the build() method. When called from this class, it will return a `Product` type with the attributes we set previously.

**Classic approach:**

```ts
class Website {
  constructor(
    public name?: string,
    public host?: string,
    public port?: number,
    public isPremium?: boolean
  ) { }
}

interface WebsiteBuilder {
  setName(name: string): WebsiteBuilder;
  setHost(host: string): WebsiteBuilder;
  setPort(port: number): WebsiteBuilder;
  setIsPremium(isPremium: boolean): WebsiteBuilder;
  build(): Website;
}

class PremiumWebsiteBuilder implements WebsiteBuilder {
  constructor(private website: Website) {
    this.clear();
  }
  setName(name: string): WebsiteBuilder {
    this.website.name = name;
    return this;
  }
  setHost(host: string): WebsiteBuilder {
    this.website.host = host;
    return this;
  }
  setPort(port: number): WebsiteBuilder {
    this.website.port = port;
    return this;
  }
  setIsPremium(): WebsiteBuilder {
    this.website.isPremium = true;
    return this;
  }
  build(): Website {
    const website = this.website;
    this.clear();
    return website;
  }
  clear(): void {
    this.website = new Website();
    this.website.isPremium = true;
  }
}

const wb = new PremiumWebsiteBuilder();
wb.setName("example").setHost("localhost").setPort(3000);
const website = wb.build();
```

**Modern approach**

* Full reusable
* Uses ES6 Proxies and `Object.assign`

This is mainly to avoid reiterating and manually providing setter methods for all the Product properties.

**Drawback**: Complex and not too readable. Uses `Prox`y which is not an easy-to-understand data structure.

```ts
export type Builder<T> = {
  [k in keyof T]-?: (arg: T[k]) => Builder<T>;
} & {
  build(): T;
};
export function ModelBuilder<T>(): Builder<T> {
  const built: Record<string, unknown> = {};
  const builder = new Proxy(
    {},
    {
      get(target, prop) {
        if ("build" === prop) {
          return () => built;
        }
        return (x: unknown): unknown => {
          built[prop.toString()] = x;
          return builder;
        };
      },
    }
  );
  return builder as Builder<T>;
}
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const user = ModelBuilder<User>()
  .id(1)
  .name("Theo")
  .email("theo@example.com")
  .build();
```

**Criticisms of the Builder pattern**

1. *You will need to write and maintain distinct Builders*. This can become a maintenance issue if you are only creating Builders to differ only in one property. It's best if you provide a general Builder for most of the cases.
2. You will have to avoid side effects when creating objects such as network requests or those that require OS access. All calls should perform mutable or immutable changes atomically.
3. Sometimes you can create objects in TypeScript by abstracting some parts using a function instead of using those Builder interfaces and excessive setter methods.

**Real world examples**

1. **Lodash**: This is a JavaScript utility library that offers a chainable API.

```js
const users = [
	{ 'user': 'alex', 'age': 20},
	{ 'user': 'theo', 'age': 40 },
	{ 'user': 'mike', 'age': 15 }
];

_.chain(users)
	.sortBy('age')
	.head()
	.value(); // Object {user: 'mike', age: 15}
```
