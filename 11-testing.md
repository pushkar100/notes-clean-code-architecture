# Testing 

Testing is more important than shipping. If you have no tests or an inadequate amount, then every time you ship code you won't be sure that you didn't break anything. Deciding on what constitutes an adequate amount is up to your team, but having 100% coverage (all statements and branches) is how you achieve very high confidence and developer peace of mind. This means that in addition to having a great testing framework, you also need to use a good coverage tool.

There's no excuse to not write tests. There are plenty of good JS test frameworks, so find one that your team prefers. When you find one that works for your team, then aim to always write tests for every new feature/module you introduce. If your preferred method is Test Driven Development (TDD), that is great, but the main point is to just make sure you are reaching your coverage goals before launching any feature, or refactoring an existing one.

## 1. Single concept per test

```javascript
// Bad!
import assert from "assert";

describe("MomentJS", () => {
  it("handles date boundaries", () => {
    let date;

    date = new MomentJS("1/1/2015");
    date.addDays(30);
    assert.equal("1/31/2015", date);

    date = new MomentJS("2/1/2016");
    date.addDays(28);
    assert.equal("02/29/2016", date);

    date = new MomentJS("2/1/2015");
    date.addDays(28);
    assert.equal("03/01/2015", date);
  });
});
```

```javascript
// Good!
import assert from "assert";

describe("MomentJS", () => {
  it("handles 30-day months", () => {
    const date = new MomentJS("1/1/2015");
    date.addDays(30);
    assert.equal("1/31/2015", date);
  });

  it("handles leap year", () => {
    const date = new MomentJS("2/1/2016");
    date.addDays(28);
    assert.equal("02/29/2016", date);
  });

  it("handles non-leap year", () => {
    const date = new MomentJS("2/1/2015");
    date.addDays(28);
    assert.equal("03/01/2015", date);
  });
});
```
